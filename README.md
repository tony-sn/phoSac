PhoSac Festival 2022 Landing Page

## Project Description:

This is the landing page that I made for my client during the Lunar New Year festival, at which they needed to promote for their services to the community.
The product was finished in just one week, therefore there are still some errors/glitches that I would like to make different if I had more time.

## My Decision:
NextJS was the first framework coming to my mind, because its server side rendering is quick and help SEO process become more efficient, and blend naturally with the business's Facebook marketing campaign.

## Technologies that I used:
- NextJS
- Chakra-UI
- Emotion
- Framer Motion
- Fireworks-js

## Deployment:
Vercel is the trusted hosting provider that I always use to host landing pages/portfolio sites

## Glitches:
- The company's logo at dark theme is still have a black background
- The fireworks is running at light theme, which does not make much sense based on the context
- The language should change to viewers' preference accordingly 

## Achievement / Final Words:
Even though the project was a bit rush and contains glitches, it still reaches more than a thousand of viewers and helped the business increase their sales by 35%.
If I have at least a month to plan the project, I would improve its structure, overall design and use a better logo etc.
